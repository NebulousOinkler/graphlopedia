## Updates and Edits:
* References should be given as a bibtex string for now
* Later goal will be to integrate it as a JSON object, however, this isn't the first priority
  * use pandoc-citeproc --bib2json to convert the bib files into the appropriate JSON
  * Why use JSON instead of bib?:
    - JSON can easly be made into an SQL database for website in future.
